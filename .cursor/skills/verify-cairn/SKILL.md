# Verify Cairn

Cairn is a Next.js desk plus JSON/MCP API on port **4721** by default. Verification uses a **separate production instance on port 14721** with its own `CAIRN_HOME` scratch directory. Next.js allows only one `next dev` process per repo, so the verify instance runs `npm run start` after the skill-owned `scripts/build-desk.sh` — it can run alongside your normal `cairn dev` on 4721.

**Primary surface:** HTTP API (`GET/POST /api/cairn`) and the desk at `/`.  
**Secondary:** CLI (`node bin/cairn.mjs …`) and stdio MCP (`cairn mcp`).

Feature map: [`features/README.md`](features/README.md).

## Launch

From the repo root:

```bash
chmod +x .cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/*.sh
.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/launch.sh
```

This:

1. Creates `.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scratch/<run-id>/project/` with an isolated `CAIRN_HOME` at that project's `.cairn`
2. Runs `node bin/cairn.mjs init --project --demo` in that project (sample beliefs for canvas pods)
3. Runs the skill-owned `scripts/build-desk.sh` (Next production build with tests excluded from typecheck), then `npm run start -- --port 14721` in tmux session `cairn-verify-<run-id>`
4. Waits until `GET http://127.0.0.1:14721/api/cairn` succeeds
5. Writes `.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scratch/instance.json` (session name, port, paths)

Do **not** use stock `npm run build` from this skill. That typechecks `**/*.ts` including `cli/main.test.ts`, which fails a pre-existing `ProcessEnv` / `NODE_ENV` typing error (product gap — report it, do not patch `cli/` or product `tsconfig.json` here). `build-desk.sh` flattens [`tsconfig.verify.json`](tsconfig.verify.json) (extends the product config, excludes `**/*.test.ts`) into scratch and points Next at it via [`scripts/tsconfig-overlay.cjs`](scripts/tsconfig-overlay.cjs) so product config files are never written.

**Ready signal:** `curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:14721/api/cairn` returns JSON with `"kind":"recalled"`.

**Desk URL:** API curls to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/cairn` are correct. For the **desk UI** on `cairn dev`, open `http://localhost:<port>/`. `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` may fail to hydrate (403 on `/_next` JS chunks / `allowedDevOrigins`) because `cairn dev` binds `--hostname 0.0.0.0` and Next's default allowlist includes `localhost` but not `127.0.0.1`. The verify instance uses production `next start`, where that origin guard does not apply; still prefer `localhost` when driving the desk in a browser, and keep `127.0.0.1` for curl.

**Teardown:** always run cleanup when finished (success or failure):

```bash
.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

Override port with `VERIFY_CAIRN_PORT=14722 scripts/launch.sh` if 14721 is taken.

**Do not** run a second `launch.sh` while `instance.json` exists — cleanup first. Refusing to double-drive avoids corrupting the shared verification instance.

## Doctor

Run before driving whenever anything looks off:

```bash
.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/doctor.sh
```

Checks:

- `scratch/instance.json` exists
- The tmux session named in that file is alive
- `GET /api/cairn` on the verify port returns `kind: recalled`
- `CAIRN_HOME` directory exists

Exit 0 prints `OK: session=… port=…`. Non-zero means launch again or cleanup stale state.

## Drive

Pick a feature from [`features/README.md`](features/README.md). Prefer the HTTP path when proving persistence; use the browser when proving desk UX. CLI init (`drive-cli-init.sh`) and the Cursor Agent Plugin (`drive-cursor-plugin.sh`) do not need a verify instance — do not double-launch to run them.

### HTTP API — assert + recall (default proof)

```bash
.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/drive-api-assert-recall.sh
```

Posts a unique assert to `POST /api/cairn`, recalls via `GET /api/cairn`, validates the belief appears with the expected value, and optionally confirms the row in SQLite. Prints the evidence directory path on success.

Manual equivalent:

```bash
PORT=14721
curl -sf "http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/api/cairn" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"kind":"assert","idempotencyKey":"manual-1","onConflict":"fail","draft":{"entity":"env:verify","attribute":"verify.marker","value":{"kind":"text","text":"hello"},"provenance":{"kind":"observed","command":"curl","session":"verify"},"validity":{"kind":"until-superseded"}}}'
curl -sf "http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/api/cairn" | node -e "const b=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf8')); console.log(b.beliefs.filter(x=>x.current.attribute==='verify.marker').length)"
```

### Desk UI — Agent API panel (browser)

Requires a running verify instance (`launch.sh` + `doctor.sh`).

1. Open `http://localhost:14721/` (see **Desk URL** above; do not use `127.0.0.1` on `cairn dev`)
2. In the right **Agent API** card, click the **Assert** tab (`role=tab`, name `Assert`)
3. Edit the JSON `idempotencyKey` to a unique value; set `draft.attribute` to `desk.verify.marker`
4. Click **Send request**
5. Confirm the **Response** pane shows `"kind": "asserted"`
6. Confirm the left **Live beliefs** table lists `desk.verify.marker` (search with `aria-label="Search beliefs"` if needed)

Use the Browser-use MCP or `computerUse` subagent for screenshots. Do not use `POST /api/cairn/reset` as a user shortcut — it is dev-only and not part of the agent contract.

### CLI recall

With `instance.json` present, read `cairnHome` and run:

```bash
CAIRN_HOME=<from instance.json> CAIRN_DB_PATH=<from instance.json> node bin/cairn.mjs recall
```

Stdout must be JSON with `"kind":"recalled"`.

## Evidence

Each drive writes to:

```
.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/evidence/<timestamp>-<pid>/
```

Typical files:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `recall-before.json` | Beliefs before the action |
| `assert-response.json` | POST assert response |
| `recall-after.json` | Beliefs after the action |
| `db-facts.txt` | Raw fact rows from SQLite (when `sqlite3` is available) |
| `summary.txt` | Human-readable pass/fail metadata |

**Proof standards:**

- Exercise the real user/agent path (`POST /api/cairn` or desk **Send request**), not in-process store calls
- Capture both the action (request body) and resulting state (recall JSON + DB when possible)
- Verify side effects in SQLite alongside the HTTP response
- Do not mock the store; the verify instance uses real SQLite under scratch `CAIRN_HOME`

Evidence survives `cleanup.sh`. Commit evidence only when explicitly asked; it is gitignored by default.

## Cleanup

```bash
.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

Kills the tmux session recorded in `instance.json`, removes that run's scratch directory, and deletes `instance.json`. **Does not** delete `evidence/`.

After cleanup, confirm proof still exists:

```bash
ls .cursor/skills/verify-cairn/evidence/
```

Never `pkill node` or `killall` — only kill the named tmux session from `instance.json`.

## Helpers

All scripts live in `.cursor/skills/verify-cairn/scripts/` and must be executable (`chmod +x`).

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `launch.sh` | Isolated production instance on port 14721 |
| `build-desk.sh` | Skill-owned `next build` (excludes `**/*.test.ts`; does not edit product config) |
| `doctor.sh` | Pre-flight health check |
| `drive-api-assert-recall.sh` | HTTP assert + recall proof |
| `drive-canvas.sh` | Canvas page + layout API proof |
| `drive-cli-init.sh` | `init --project` ignores `CAIRN_HOME`; `--demo` empty-store refusal; overlay recall (no desk) |
| `drive-cli-recall.sh` | CLI recall JSON proof |
| `drive-retract.sh` | POST retract + absent from recall |
| `drive-cursor-plugin.sh` | Plugin manifests + skills (no desk, no IDE injection) |
| `cleanup.sh` | Tear down instance, keep evidence |

## Maintenance

When routes, ports, selectors, or the JSON contract change, update the matching file under `features/` and re-run this skill end-to-end. Use `/maintain-verification-skill` for the maintenance workflow.
